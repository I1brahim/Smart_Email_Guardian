## 🔧 Technical Challenges and Solutions

### **Challenge 1: Data Structure Mismatch**
**Problem**: History table displaying "N/A" instead of actual scan results
**Root Cause**: Inconsistent data format between `/scan` and `/history` endpoints
**Solution**: Standardized data structure mapping and implemented proper error handling
**Learning**: The importance of consistent API design and thorough testing

### **Challenge 2: Model Integration Complexity**
**Problem**: Difficulty integrating two different ML models with separate vectorizers
**Root Cause**: Each model required its own preprocessing pipeline
**Solution**: Created modular model loading system with proper error handling
**Learning**: Code organization and separation of concerns are crucial for maintainability

### **Challenge 3: Deployment Size Limitations**
**Problem**: Vercel serverless functions had 50MB limit, models were too large
**Root Cause**: Large ML model files exceeding platform constraints
**Solution**: Separated frontend (Vercel) and backend (Render) deployment strategy
**Learning**: Understanding platform limitations and choosing appropriate hosting solutions

### **Challenge 4: Security Implementation**
**Problem**: Needed to secure API endpoints without compromising functionality
**Root Cause**: Public deployment requires protection against unauthorized access
**Solution**: Implemented Bearer token authentication with input sanitization
**Learning**: Security should be integrated from the beginning, not added as an afterthought

### **Challenge 5: CORS Configuration**
**Problem**: Frontend couldn't communicate with backend due to cross-origin restrictions
**Root Cause**: Different domains for frontend and backend in production
**Solution**: Properly configured CORS headers and domain whitelisting
**Learning**: Understanding web security fundamentals and browser restrictions

## 🎨 Design and Architecture Decisions

### **Dual-Model Architecture Choice:**
**Decision**: Use two specialized models instead of one multi-class classifier
**Reasoning**: 
- Higher accuracy through specialized training
- Better confidence scoring and risk assessment
- Flexibility in model updates and improvements
**Result**: Achieved superior performance compared to single-model approaches

### **Frontend Technology Stack:**
**Decision**: React with inline CSS-in-JS styling
**Reasoning**: 
- Component-based architecture for maintainability
- No external dependencies for styling
- Better performance without CSS framework overhead
**Result**: Fast, responsive interface with consistent design

### **Backend Architecture:**
**Decision**: Flask with JSON file storage
**Reasoning**: 
- Lightweight and fast for ML model serving
- Simple data persistence without database complexity
- Easy deployment and maintenance
**Result**: Reliable API with good performance

### **Deployment Strategy:**
**Decision**: Split frontend (Vercel) and backend (Render) deployment
**Reasoning**: 
- Leverage each platform's strengths
- Avoid serverless size limitations
- Better scalability and performance
**Result**: Robust production deployment with optimal resource usage
